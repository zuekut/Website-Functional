                        <h2>SAFETY & MEDICAL</h2>
                        <p><strong>STAY HYDRATED</strong><br>Drinking plenty of water throughout the weekend is vital to your health and safety. Drink water at regular intervals, and be sure to stay hydrated on the days leading up to the show. While you’re here, fill up on H20 at any of our <strong>FREE hydration stations</strong>, or purchase water at various concession stands around the venue. <br><br>
                            <strong>FASHION & FUNCTION</strong><br>Come prepared for all types of weather, and definitely dress for comfort. Wear clothes that are lightweight and breathable and, above all, make you feel good. If you choose to wear heavy fabrics and faux furs, remember to stay hydrated. Comfortable sneakers are the best way to go, especially if you’re planning to tear up the dancefloor. Sandals and flip-flops can make for sore feet. <br><br>
                            <strong>USE THE BUDDY SYSTEM</strong><br>It’s easy to get separated at a festival. Know where your friends are, set up meeting points, and stick together—two or three brains are better than one! If you think a new or old friend needs help, ask our friendly staff to assist; and always leave the show with everyone in your crew.<br><br>
                            <strong>MEDICAL STATIONS</strong><br>In the first aid tents located throughout the festival, you’ll find teams of medical practitioners ready to care for your every need—free of charge! If you’re lightheaded or nauseated or have too many blisters from dancing the night away, please visit our friendly medical staff, or ask a Wood Festival team member for assistance.<br><br>
                            <strong>ROAMING MEDICAL TEAMS</strong><br>If you happen to see Wood Festival Health & Safety Team officers roaming through the venue, give them a high-five! These heroic people stay on their feet for the entirety of every event to keep a watchful, caring eye on you! And if either you or a friend has a medical concern, flag one of those friendly folks down.<br><br>
                            <strong>GROUND CONTROL</strong>
                            Ground Control is a family of team members who are dedicated to helping Headliners stay happy, healthy and hydrated at the events! You can spot their signature green shirts and fanny packs as they make their way through all areas of the festival. Please approach any of them if you want assistance or simply need a friend! We strongly believe in the beauty and power of helping others, and we’ll do everything we can to make sure you have a safe, memorable experience.
                        </p>
                        <br><h2>FOOD & BEVERAGES</h2>
                        <p>The Wood Festival has several food stands called ‘Branches’. They have a wide variety of food and snacks available conveniently located all around the amphitheatre. There are vegetarian options as well as the standard fare.
                            <br>Drinks are available for purchase at the concession stands and on-site stores. Beer and sprits may be purchased at the same ‘Branches’ only by adults displaying valid age-ID. No beverages may be brought from the outside into the event’s grounds except one 20oz factory sealed bottle of water. Free water refill stations will be available all over the Wood Festival grounds.

                        <h2>PAYING</h2>
                        <p>At the festival there is a new innovative way to pay for your drinks and food. At entering the festival you will receive an <strong>RFID band</strong> that will be your way of paying. The RFID card is connected to your name and you will be able to top up the balance at one of our top up stations or on our website prior to visiting the festival. You can not only pay for consumables with your card, you will also have the opportunity to rent various electronic devices to enhance your experience.</p>
